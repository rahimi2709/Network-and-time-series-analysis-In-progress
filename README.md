# Network-and-time-series-analysis-In-progress-
In this project, I will use time series analysis and network analysis tools to conjoin data sources from the social networking sites to formulate a detailed view of the #UbirajaraBelongstoBR protest's spatial (the Where) and temporal (the When) dynamics, as well as the text-based and possibly graphical content (the What), and the users (the Who) that are trying to drive this virtual networking movement. This project will combine network science, machine learning (ML), and natural language processing (NLP) to provide computational social science research that is relevant. The methodology is creating an application that can create several results by analyzing the collected data (Comments, Hashtag, or any other types of contribution of users) in Data Science formulations. The results are answers to some predicted questions to evaluate the social event in different views.
